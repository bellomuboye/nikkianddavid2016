            <p>
              On a rainy autumn day in 2008 at Cornell University, Nikki
              Nussbaum had forgotten her umbrella. She walked back from her a
              cappella practice to her apartment in Collegetown utterly
              drenched. As rainwater dripping from her hair and clothes formed a
              puddle on the elevator floor, she desperately tapped the
              door-close button, hoping no one would see her in this state.
              Alas, the doors failed to close fast enough, and onto the elevator
              stepped a tall, handsome, and perfectly dry David Sharon. He
              smiled in amusement as Nikki blushed, surprised to learn that this
              smooth character was none other than her next-door neighbor.
            </p>
            <p>
              David was not so surprised. He had, in fact, noticed Nikki years
              earlier at the beginning of freshman year. David can still recall
              the first time he saw her walking across North Campus with her
              friend Skyler, as his friends commented on the pair. David was
              intrigued and became a regular reader of Nikki's column in the
              Cornell Daily Sun. Fate intervened during his senior year. When
              David considered renting an apartment in Collegetown, the landlord
              cleverly intimated that the neighboring apartment was being rented
              by a group of very pretty girls, including “that columnist from
              the paper.” David was sold.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon after their elevator encounter, David dropped by Nikki's
              apartment to say hello on his way to the library. He never made it
              there, though, because that quick hello turned into an eight-hour
              conversation that neither of them wanted to end. They started
              dating, and continued to date long-distance after graduation. Four
              long years and three professional degrees later, the couple
              finally reunited in New York City.
            </p>
            <p>
              They now live next to Gramercy Park, which cannot be entered
              without a key. Not to be deterred, David secretly procured one and
              <button class="d-link proposed-modal-trigger">proposed to Nikki</button>
              as it began to drizzle in the park on March 14, 2015. She was
              never so happy to have been caught in the rain.
